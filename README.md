# JSBehindScenes

## About

In this repository, I'm sharing what I'm learning about the behind-the-scenes of JavaScript and how this language really works. My goal is to take my basic knowledge of JavaScript to a new level so I can better understand everything I've picked up so far. ðŸš€

## Why is this important?

Understanding how JavaScript works will help me write better code and make sense of what other developers are doing. This journey is all about becoming a more confident and successful developer! 

Exploring the details of JavaScript is a way to stand out and boost my skills. ðŸ“š
