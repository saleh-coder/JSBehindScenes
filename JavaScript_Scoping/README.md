# JavaScript Scope Study

This repository contains an example study on scope in JavaScript, including global variables, function scope, and block scope. The code demonstrates how different types of scope work and how variables and functions can be accessed in different contexts.

## Content

The file includes the following concepts:

- Global variables and functions
- Function scope
- Inner functions that have access to the parent scope
- Block scope using `if` statements
- The difference between variables declared with `var`, `let`, and `const`

## Course
