# JavaScript Hoisting Examples

This repository contains examples illustrating the concept of hoisting in JavaScript. Hoisting is a mechanism in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.

## Examples Included

- **Example 1:** Hoisting with Functions and Variables

  - Demonstrates how functions can be called before they are declared and how variables declared with `var`, `let`, and `const` behave.

- **Example 2:** Hoisting with Functions and Arrow Functions

  - Compares the behavior of regular function declarations and arrow functions.

- **Example 3:** Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

  - Illustrates the concept of TDZ with `const` and how variables declared with `var` behave without it.

- **Example 4:** Differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`
  - Shows how these declarations are hoisted and their behavior during execution.

## How to Run

To run the examples, simply execute the `JavaScript_Hoisting` file using a JavaScript environment (like Node.js or in the browser console).
